<p>I am a first-year Masters student in Geographic Information Science at Clark University. My research interests focus on balancing human needs 
with environmental sustainability, as well as demographic change, migration, and political geography. Through my coursework, I am developing high-level skills 
in geospatial technologies, the science of remote sensing and statistics, and Python programming for GIS and data analysis.</p>

<p>I also work as a Software Tester for Clark Labs, a department of the Graduate School of Geography at Clark, which develops the TerrSet Geospatial
Monitoring and Modeling System, first released in 1987 and used in over 180 countries. Finally, I have studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through
Learning Fuze's prep course for web development.</p>
<p>With a strong foundation in research and writing from my Bachelor of Arts in History with a minor in Geography from Central Connecticut State University, 
I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and social sciences with GIS. A life-long map nerd, my passion for geographic knowledge drives all my work. 
Outside of my studies and coding, I am an avid home cook and enjoy bird watching, reading (from Russian literature to fantasy/sci-fi), and the Mountain Goats 
(band and animal). Born and raised in Connecticut, I have lived in Massachusetts, West Virginia, and now Florida, and love exploring the natural and cultural 
beauty of wherever I am. </p>
